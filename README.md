# Astro Rolodex

[Astro 3.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3/) has just been released so I want to try out these snazzy new transitions using `ViewTransition`

This is the repo for my first attempt.

Note: Couldn't get transitions working when pages are created from Markdown files. I suspect the transition name needs to be unique e.g `pfp-{bio-name}` instead of `profile-picturee`
